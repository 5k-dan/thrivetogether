## About the Project
As a college student, I understand how stressful and overwhelming life can get. Over Thanksgiving break, I decided to create **Thrive Together**, a website aimed at providing students with easy access to resources, affirmations, and a supportive community. 

This project is a work in progress, and Iâ€™m excited to continue improving it!
